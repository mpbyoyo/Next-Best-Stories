It was on this open\n space that the house looked; and as the house was\n built of stone, and leaned up against the ledge behind\n it, one could hardly tell where man's hand had begun,\n or where left off. The stones might almost have been\n flung together by a boy at play; yet, rough as they\n were, they fitted close, and kept the weather out. The "

To this end\n they looked in at the windows, which stood open all\n summer long, and saw many things which must have\n surprised them. The squirrels went in boldly, several\n times a day; so did the birds, the braver of them;\n and all came out looking pleased with themselves\n and with things in general. So there was necessarily\n something or somebody pleasant inside the house.\n \n I said that the trees stood well back from the house\n in the wood. I ought to have excepted three, a stately\n pine, and two glorious yellow birches, which stood\n close to it, as close as might be. In fact, part of the\n hut seemed to be built round the bole of the pine,\n which disappeared for several feet, as if the stones\n had clasped it in a rough embrace, and refused to let\n go their hold. The birches were a few feet from the\n door, but near enough for one to lean out of window\n and pull off the satin fringes. Their roots swelled\n out above the ground, and twisted themselves into\n curves that might make a delightful seat, under the\n green bending canopy, through whose waving folds\n the trunk glistened like a giant prince of rags and\n tatters. In the centre of the tiny glade stood a\n buttonwood-tree, whose vast girth seemed curiously out\n of proportion to its surroundings. The pine and the\n birches were noble trees; all the forest round was full\n of towering stems and knotted, powerful branches; but "

If there had been any one to measure the\n trunk, he would have found a girth of twenty-five feet\n or more, near the base; while above the surrounding\n forest, it towered a hundred feet and more in air. At\n a height of twelve or fifteen feet appeared an opening,\n two or three feet in diameter. A hollow? surely!\n not so large as that in the Lycian plane-tree, where\n Licinius Mucianus dined with nineteen companions,\n yes, and slept too, and enjoyed himself immensely,\n - but large enough to hold two or three persons with\n all comfort, if not convenience. As for the number of\n squirrels it might hold, that was past counting; they\n were running in and out all day long, and made such\n a noise that they disturbed the woodpeckers, and made\n them irritable of a hot day.\n \n There never was such a wood for birds! Partly from\n its great age, partly from favourable accidents of soil\n and aspect, it had accumulated an unusual variety of\n trees; and any bird, looking about for a good building\n site, was sure of finding just the particular tree he\n liked best, with building materials, food, and every\n other requisite to heart's desire. So the trees rustled\n and quivered with wings, and rang with song, all day\n long, except in the hot sleepy noons, when most\n respectable birds keep within nests, and only the\n woodthrush from time to time sends out his few\n perfect notes, to show that all times are alike to the\n true singer.  Not content with the forest itself, some\n families - I think they were ruby-crowned wrens and "
